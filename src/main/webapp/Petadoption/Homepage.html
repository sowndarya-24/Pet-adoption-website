	Hundreds of pets are abandoned and rescued in India everyday. Although there are many wonderful souls across the nation who work extra hours and put in efforts beyond their capacity, there is always a shortage of funding and communication across the animal activist circuit.Our ultimate goal is reduce pets over-population by providing loving homes for all the homeless pets , and at the same time helping every human share their lives with a furry companion that they so dearly want.
